However those don’t apply for every illegal immigrant. First off it says you must establish you fear persecution in your own country. And also you must prove that you’re being persecuted based on race, religion, political opinions, or a particular social group. But let’s be honest here. Most illegal immigrants don’t want to wait for the process. We’ve seen it recently with the caravan who tried to storm ports of entries into the United States. Most illegal immigrants don’t want to wait the 180 days it could take for a decision and they feel their best option is to cross the border illegally.","reactions":{"like":{"$numberInt":"1"},"total":{"$numberInt":"1"}},"author":"Matt Parliament","profile":"https://mobile.facebook.com/profile.php"}

Obama did all he could in eight years to pull us out of the recession that Bush put us into so if any credit is deserving then it goes to him. Your president despises Mexico so much yet when he had a clothing line on the market, it was manufactured in Mexico. I know that for a fact because before he even considered to be president, I had two very nice dress shirts with his label that came from Macys. Made in Mexico. Why wasnt his brand made in USA? I didnt care at the time for I just liked the shirts. We have a hypocritical, lying, narcissistic scumbag running our country feeding BS to his gullible and naive followers. Anything he disagrees with is fake news. Just like he said they have built part of the wall. No sir, not true. Fact is only 31 miles of a fence on the border has been mended and repaired. Thats it. So you can praise this POS that you voted for and stand behind him all you want. You got through 2020 and then it will take a different turn. Congress gained 40 Democratic seats. One senator just flipped her Republican seat and turned Democrat which made the senate margin that much shorter. You keep supporting him long as you can.

No wall. There are photos of her house from when there was a protest in front of it. It is NOT the white painted house with a huge wall being circulated on the internet by right-wingers as hers.\n\nSoros lives in NYC. No wall.\n\nAfter Kennedy delivered a rebuttal to Donald Trump’s February 2018 state of the union address, a photograph purportedly showing a wall around his Palm Beach home appeared online. In that instance, the pictured house also did not belong to Joe Kennedy — although his family did own that home until the future congressman was 14. The wall in the photograph was not a security wall, but a seawall built to protect the oceanfront property from water damage.\n\nThe Clintons have built a wall around their Chappaqua house, because of death threats by right-wing idiots -- and right-wing terrorism is the main source of terrorist-related deaths in the U.S.\n\nAnd besides that, a nation-state and private property are two completely different things.\n\nAnd there's the tiny fact that the majority of undocumented immigrants are here because they overstayed their visas, not because they crossed the southern border illegally. Net movement across the border has for some years been at zero or INTO Mexico.\n\nI know, facts are just so inconvenient for Trump supporters.","reactions":{"like":{"$numberInt":"1"},"total":{"$numberInt":"1"}},"author":"Karen Hollis","profile":"https://mobile.facebook.com/profile.php"}

If you truly think that these confused zombie liberals are only in America, then you better wake the hell up. These demonic liberal entities are every where, and have helped their country's leaders destroy their own country. Just to name a few, Germany, Sweden, France, Canada, Italy, and Australia, these zombie ( liberals) demon seeds are everywhere, and all of those countries have been infected! That's why it's so much more important to hang unto our 2nd Amendment (A.K.A. our guns), close our borders, and stop paying all of these countries hundreds of billions of dollars to them that have nothing but ill intentions towards the United States. that's why I've voted for President Trump, and I will again come 2020! Learn the real definition of \"Nationalist\", Trump declared he is one at one of his recent rallies, and so I am. If you happen to live in the USA and you don't like the fact that it is also occupied by true patriots, committed to preserving our country as a sovereign nation, then get the hell out, and don't let the border wall kick you in the ass!

Experiments prove a hypothesis and that has yet to happen with man made climate change. There was a day and age where the learned experts at the time also said that the earth was flat. They had no evidence, just their superior intellect. Just so happened they didn't have a superior intellect, just an inflated ego over their opinion. It was those who were out in the world everyday, sail ships, travelling across vast deserts and steppes who observed and interacted with nature, the world and the enviroment first hand who said no, the earth is not flat. You can see the curvature when you look to the horizion so you are wrong on learned ones. The learned ones then looked down on the people who did not have their education and called them stupid and dangerous. So happens the learned ones were just retarding the economic growth of the world through their worship of flat earth science. What has and always will affect the climate of this planet is solar activity occuring on the surface of the sun. So, unless you can show me how man is affecting activity on the surface of the sun, don't try to ram \"man made global warming is proven science\" down our throats.","reactions":{"like":{"$numberInt":"14"},"love":{"$numberInt":"4"},"haha":{"$numberInt":"3"},"total":{"$numberInt":"21"}},"author":"Randy Johnson","profile":"https://mobile.facebook.com/randy.johnson.7528"}

Some due to mathematical errors and others now claim they were pushed by the last administration into going along with human climate change. And now that they have spoken out they are being shunned by other scientists.","reactions":{"like":{"$numberInt":"2"},"haha":{"$numberInt":"1"},"total":{"$numberInt":"3"}},"author":"David Zickefoose","profile":"https://mobile.facebook.com/david.zickefoose.5"}

Look at the statistics that cover more than the last 10 years. During the last ice age the amount of carbon dioxide in the air was several times what it is now. The reality is that no one can accurately predict what the climate will be like any more that a day or two ahead. And the US is the only nation that has actually reduced its carbon emissions over the past years. Climate changes but very slowly and we haven't changed that.

Is America really that ignorant to believe that he could be better than Hillary as President? ??\n🌟 Hillary is a ROCKSTAR! 🌟 Hillary's LONG list of credible accomplishments is truly amazing over the decades, but it's so sad that people only \"cherry-pick\" the few bad things, & totally ignore all the good things.... Hillary's' accomplishments, Enough said. 😉👏 Hillary Clinton's contributions to American society as a woman are many, but the overall theme of her efforts is that she has continued to stay involved in the great issues of her time, despite setbacks, &criticism of her actions. Throughout her life, she has been a strong advocate for women, children and families. In 1988, & 1991, she was listed as one of the 100 Most Influential Lawyers in America by the National Law Journal. As a Senator, she sponsored such measures as: (1) The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, to ensure the safety of prescription drugs for children; (2) She worked to increase provisions in the Children's Health Insurance Program to help schools address environmental hazards; (3) She introduced legislation to help recruit and retain nurses to fight AIDS and to expand the use of Medical Technology. Hillary Clinton demonstrated her committment to public service soon after becoming a lawyer. (1) She served as head of the American Bar Association Committee on Women in the Profession. (2) She was also Chair of the Board of the Children's Defense Fund, a national advocacy group for the interests of children, from 1986-1991. As First Lady of Arkansas, & of the U.S., she showed that these positions could be more than ceremonial. (1) She headed a commission in Arkansas which expanded, & reformed education throughout the state. (2) As the U.S. First Lady, she led efforts to make adoption easier for families, to provide more money for breast cancer research and to increase healthcare and employment opportunities for women. As a U.S. Senator, she has been recognized for her efforts on behalf of the U.S. military. She received the Secretary of Defense Medal for Outstanding Public Service, United States Department of Defense and the Military Order of the Purple Heart. She is the first New York Senator to serve on the Armed Services Committee, & she was asked by the Dept of Defense to serve as the only Senate member of the Transformation Advisory Group to the Joint Forces Command, in 2004. These Senate duties allowed Hilary Clinton to break out of the traditional mold as a woman involved in setting public policy. In spite of the controversy surrounding her as a public figure and the negative attacks, she has sustained from her opponents, Hillary Clinton has established herself as a balanced, nuanced credible woman. As U.S. Secretary of State, (1) Clinton was in the forefront of the U.S. response to the Arab Spring, including advocating the military intervention in Libya. (2) She introduced the Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review process to the State Department, seeking to maximize departmental effectiveness and promote the empowerment of women worldwide; (3) She used \"smart power\" as the strategy for asserting U.S. leadership and values in the world. (4) She championed the use of social media in getting the U.S. Message out; and (5) She is the most widely traveled secretary during her time in office. She has achieved worldwide recognition as the keynote speaker at the United Nations Fifth International Conference on Women, in Beijing China. Her speech on behalf of the global rights of women caused some controversy because it insisted that women should have the same basic rights, no matter where they lived and this was a new U.S. policy position. Among the awards she has received are: (1) the Elie Wiesel Foundation Humanitarian Award; (2) the Martin Luther King Jr. Award; (3) Family Circle Woman Who Makes a Difference Lifetime Achievement Award; (4) National Federation of Black Women Business Owners, Black Women of Courage Award; (5) National Association of Elementary School Principals Distinguished Service Award; (6) Save the Children Distinguished Service Award, The National Council for Adoption, \"For advocacy on behalf of adoption\"; (7) Henrietta Szold Award, Hadassah; (8) the Irish American Peace Prize; (9) the United Arab Emirates Health Foundation Award for her work in Health & Social Welfare; (10) Lifetime Achievement Award for her work and support of the children of Chernobyl; and (11) the Mother Theresa Award for her humanitarian efforts following the Kosovo War. Although her major initiative, the Clinton health care plan failed, it certainly set the groundwork for the health care law we have today, the Affordable Care Act. And she played a leading role in advocating the creation of the State Children's Health Insurance Program, which provides state support for children whose parents cannot provide them with health coverage. She promoted nationwide immunization against childhood illnesses. She also played a leading role in creation of the Adoption and Safe Families Act and the Foster Care Independence Act. She encouraged older women to seek a mammogram for early detection of breast cancer (which is covered by Medicare) and successfully sought to increase research funding for prostate cancer and childhood asthma at the NIH. She worked to investigate illnesses that were reportedly affecting Veterans of the Gulf War; now commonly known as Gulf War Syndrome. And she created an Office on Violence Against Women at the Department of Justice.

Also, that Flynn was told he did not need to have an attorney present. General Flynn will be exonerated this week and Mueller possibly found in contempt of Court. Watergate saw more than 50 people sent to prison. Spygate, the Dems attempt to destroy Trump and people in his administration, will lead to more people charged than we saw after Watergate. Trump has not committed any high crimes. Trump did not collude with Russia. Can the same be said about the Dems involved in Spygate?

How is that good? Now he wants more so he can continue his witch hunt that will end nowhere again and then ask for more money so he can look somewhere else. How is this good? He was the one who over saw the 2010 Uranium deal with Putin and friends and there's plenty of pictures to see this. hitlery and her hubby netted some 400M dollars as put to the news by Putin who said they did not pay taxes in Russia and he asked if they paid taxes in the US. MSM went blank and never followed up on it. I wonder if they would be as quiet if Trump did that. Mueller has amassed over 25M since he was in office. How do you do that on 170+/- Thou. a year? Certainly not by legal means. He is part of the leftist/liberal/Socialistic horde that wants total control of America. I am an Independent and have been one for 50 years this past Nov. and I do believe if hitlery had become Pres. we would have never found out about their corruption.

Scary that I do not support a man who has lied more than all the presidents before him COMBINED?\nSome of Trump’s lies:\n1.He said everyone would benefit from the tax cut. The richest 1% got 83% of the tax cut. 53% will pay more after taxes expire for middle income people.\n2.He said he would close “special interest loopholes especially the carried interest loophole” new law keeps it!\n3.He said he would invest $1 trillion in infrastructure creating American jobs everywhere. No money for that after tax cut.\n4.He said he would drain the swamp in DC. He has hired nothing but millionaires and specially connected “swamp dwellers” many of whom serve over companies and industries of which they were part before being appointed.\n5.He promised to bring down drug prices and rein in Big Pharma. That promise is now”inoperative”.\n6.He said he would not cut medicare & Social Security. Now due to TRILLION $ deficit, he and Paul Ryan are gutting both.\n7He said he would label China a CURRENCY MANIPULATOR. Now he’s bff with Xi Jinping, China is not a currency manipulator and Ivanka got a sweet deal to make and market her clothing in China. 8. He said women who accused him of sexual harassment would be sued after election. Election over- no lawsuits forthcoming.\n10 Said there will be consequences for companies that ship jobs overseas. Carrier, Ford, GM, etc. have all shipped plants to Mexico, NO PENALTIES! Carrier has gotten 15 gov’t contracts since doing so. 11. Said he would bring back coal. Plants and mines have closed. Forty more will close next year.\nHe said he will release his taxes as soon as the audit is over. THE AUDIT IS OVER! No taxes! What is he hiding? PANTS ON FIRE!\nThe reason he does not wish us to see his taxes:\nIn case you haven't connected the dots... Putin controls the largest oil company in Russia. He made a 500 Billion dollar deal with the CEO of Exxon Mobil. Obama put sanctions in place which stopped that deal. Russia then hacked into our government in order to get Trump elected. When the CIA told Congress this in September (James Comey was also in that meeting), Mitch McConnell refused to tell the American people, blackmailing Obama saying he would frame it as playing partisan politics during the election. Comey released the infamous no-information letter. Mitch McConnell's wife was picked for Trump's cabinet. Wonder why our President has been so quick to dismiss the CIA's findings?.........Here are some facts : Decide for yourselves 1) Trump owes Blackstone/ Bayrock group a reported $100 million to $560 million dollars (one of his largest debtors and the primary reason he won't reveal his tax returns)\n2) Blackstone is owned wholly by Russian billionaires, who owe their position to Putin and have made billions from their work with the Russian government.\n3) Other companies that have borrowed from Blackstone have claimed that owing money to them is like owing to the Russian mob and while you owe them, they own you for many favors.\n4) The Russian economy is badly faltering under the weight of its over-dependence on raw materials which as you know have plummeted in the last 2 years leaving the Russian economy scrambling to pay its debts.\n5) Russia has an impetus to influence our election to ensure the per barrel oil prices are above $65 ( they are currently hovering around $50)\n6) Russia can't affordably get at 80% of its oil reserves and reduce its per barrel cost to compete with America at $45 or Saudi Arabia at $39. With Iranian sanctions being lifted Russia will find another inexpensive competitor increasing production and pushing Russia further down the list of suppliers.\nAs for Iranian sanctions, the 6 countries lifting them allowing Iran to collect on the billions it is owed for pumping oil but not being paid for it. These billions Iran can only get if the Iranian nuclear deal is signed. Trump spoke of ending the deals which would cause oil sales sanctions to be reimposed, which would make Russian oil more competitive.\n7) Rex Tillerson (Trump's ex Secretary of State) was the head of ExxonMobil, which is in possession of patented technology that could help Putin extract 45% more oil at a significant cost savings to Russia, helping Putin put money in the Russian coffers to help reconstitute its military and finally afford to mass produce the new and improved systems that it had invented before the Russian economy had slowed so much.\n😎 Putin cannot get access to these new cost saving technologies OR outside oil field development money, due to US sanctions on Russia, because of its involvement in Ukrainian civil war.\n9) Look for Trump to end sanctions on Russia and to back out of the Iranian nuclear deal, to help Russia rebuild its economy, strengthen Putin and make Tillerson and Trump even richer, thus allowing Trump to satisfy his creditors at Blackstone.\n10) With Trump's fabricated hatred of NATO and the U.N., the Russian military reconstituted, the threat to the Baltic states is real. Russia retaking their access to the Baltic Sea from Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia and threatening the shipping of millions of cubic feet of natural gas to lower Europe from Scandinavia, allowing Russia to make a good case for its oil and gas being piped into eastern Europe.\nSources: Time Magazine, NY Times, The Atlantic, The Guardian UK......phew.....did you make it thru all of that?...\n\nRussia’s state-run media channel Russia 24 wants everyone to know that President Donald Trump belongs to Moscow.\n\nResponding to reports that Trump told world leaders at the G-7 meeting in Canada last week that Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula is Russian because everyone there speaks Russian, the hosts of the Russian version of 60 Minutes victoriously declared that “Crimea is ours, Trump is ours.”\n\nReported on June 15 2018 .\nHillary was no angel, I agree. But this man is ill prepared for the job. He lashes out at SNL for making fun of him. They have made fun of every potus since Ford but the childish one takes it personally and would like them taken off the air!😖\nHe is a carnival barker and a game show host at best.","reactions":{"haha":{"$numberInt":"1"},"total":{"$numberInt":"1"}},"author":"Joe Dever","profile":"https://mobile.facebook.com/joe.dever.7"}

Many think it’s all conspiracy theory because what is taking place is so far out of what their tiny mind can comprehend that they can’t begin to imagine it to be true, not even for a second. Then again, one has to remember that the average IQ is 100. That’s 50% of the population. A big chunk is not even there, and that chunk understands nothing. The rest is at various levels above that. IQ is not just two letters. It’s actually a number. The higher the number, the greater the level of understanding.

Those who can’t afford that level of service buy smaller packages and rent apartments in far-flung suburbs, sometimes teaming up to share lodgings and expenses.\n\nThe phenomenon has, over the years, attracted bad actors. Federal agents have raided so-called maternity hotels in California catering to women from China and Taiwan; some were coached to disguise their pregnancies when they arrived in the U.S. and lied about why they were in the country, according to federal officials. Miami-mama was raided once, too, and a notary public was indicted for making a false statement in a passport application and conspiring to commit an offense against the U.S. (That employee was immediately terminated, Lubnevskiy said.)\n\nSee also:\n\nBirth tourism brings Russian baby boom to Miami\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/birth-tourism-brings-russian-baby-boom-miami-n836121\n\nRussian Baby Boom in Miami\nhttps://politicalhotwire.com/threads/russian-baby-boom-in-miami.203435/#post-6213958\n\n----------\n\nArticle title: Ryan pushes for thousands of Irish visas before leaving office\n\nDate: 12/14/18\n\nLink:\nhttps://www.politico.com/story/2018/12/14/paul-ryan-congress-irish-visas-bill-1032517\n\nExcerpt:\n\nA bill pushed by Ryan, whose family fled famine-ravaged Ireland in 1851, could provide Irish nationals with thousands of additional U.S. work visas each year.\n\n…Breitbart, … dubbed the visa program “amnesty for Irish lobbies“ and said it would take jobs away from U.S. college graduates.\n\nThe bill would give the Irish access to unused E-3 visas, which currently are available only to Australians in \"specialty occupations\" that require a bachelor’s degree or the equivalent. In return, Ireland would offer additional work visas to Americans, among other concessions.\n\n…Ryan maintains close ties with Irish officials, and the 48-year-old Wisconsinite said earlier this year that sometime after his 60th birthday he would like to become the U.S. ambassador to Ireland.\n\nSee also:\n\nPaul Ryan Wants More Immigrants, as Long as They Look Like Him\nhttps://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/paul-ryan-irish-immigration-769807/\n\nPaul Ryan draws bipartisan backlash over visa proposal to increase Irish immigration\nhttps://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/paul-ryan-irish-immigration-bill-backlash-republican-blocking-senate-a8685381.html","reactions":{"like":{"$numberInt":"1"},"total":{"$numberInt":"1"}},"author":"Andrew Sylwester","profile":"https://mobile.facebook.com/andrew.sylwester.1"}

If that is true why are there walls and fences around their homes, Hollywood movie stars, the White House and even the Vatican. I have touched that wall. It is a big high wall about 40 feet or so high. Why do so many rich and famous people surround themselves with walls if they don’t work? Well they do work. These people all know that the best line of security starts with a physical barrier.\n\nWell then, why do these like minded people lie and vehemently deny walls as a means of securing our borders?\n\nThe truth could be that open borders has become the business model for the Democratic party. Everybody knows that letting poor dependant and needy people into the country are likely voters. Voters that can be controlled and counted on to vote to keep politicians in office.\n\nThere seems to be a political class that is willing to subvert our national identity and posterity in order to keep their elected office during THEIR LIFETIME and thus keep their hands elbow deep in the American taxpayers pockets.\n\nIn order to maintain their wealth and prestige during their lifetime they are willing and eager to permanently and irreversibly change the culture and wealth of the legal citizens of this country. They have no remorse about lowering the standard of living for our current citizens and most certainly future generations in order to maintain their current wealthy lifestyles now. The more undocumented immigrants there are the larger their potential voter pool.\n\nIf these people truly wanted to help why not leave their security gates open, put a sign in their yard that says poor needy people are welcome, leave a crock pot full of stew on the counter and a cash box next to it with a sign to take what you need to get by. Oh, and not ask to sign a guest book, just let whoever wants to just come in any way at any time. They don’t really need to know who these people that they are helping and funding actually are. This should give them that warm fuzzy feeling of helping someone in need.\n\nIf that sounds absurd... well it is. The sad part is that this is exactly what open border supporters are doing. Except... their gates are locked and the walls are high. They just want the votes and expect somebody else to pay the costs and suffer the consequences.\n\nMr. Trump, build that wall. Find out who is coming into our country. Continue your quest to bring common sense and order to the immigration debacle that scared lazy and incompetent politicians did not address for way too long. Shut down the government. Stop congressional pay, use the military to build the wall, whatever you can to stop the madness.\n\nAmericans will support you. Your approval will continue to increase.\n\nMaybe the support for open border politicians like Pelosi and Shumer will evaporate and they can retire on their absurd retirement plan that most Americans can only dream of.\n\nBUILD THE WALL\nBUILD IT TALL\nBUILD IT ALL\n\nThen again, I might be wrong.","reactions":{"total":{"$numberInt":"0"}},"author":"Don Nikirk","profile":"https://mobile.facebook.com/denikirk"}

I live on the border in California now. The wall has been a deterrent! Not for just keeping illegals from crossing at the points it is finished, but also keeps those who are trying to cross legally from being robbed and accosted by the bad element on the other side. They use to just run back across the border after robbing. They cannot do that now. The wall is like your front door. You have it there to keep you and your family safe.

During Obama's 8 years the Debt rose from $10.3 trillion to over $19 trillion, that's over $1 trillion per year. With the defict predicted by Bloomberg to rise to over $20 trillion by 2020, it means Trump has raised the debt by $1 trillion during his FIRST TERM, in other words, a rate one quarter that of Obama's. Bloomberg has always been anti-Trump, so they doctor the figures to make him look bad, but when they forecast the debt to be $20 trillion by 2020, they let the cat out of the bag.","reactions":{"total":{"$numberInt":"0"}},"author":"Jimmy Linegar","profile":"https://mobile.facebook.com/profile.php"}

They’re falling.\n\nDate: 06/15/18\n\nLink:\ngoogle: washingtonpost /news/wonk/wp/2018/06/15/for-the-biggest-group-of-american-workers-wages-arent-just-flat-theyre-falling/?utm_term=.3b4fb3c3c9ed\n\nExcerpt:\n\n…” For workers in “production and nonsupervisory” positions, the value of the average paycheck has declined in the past year. For those workers, average “real wages” — a measure of pay that takes inflation into account — fell (in the past year), the Bureau of Labor Statistics said.\n\nThis pool of workers includes those in manufacturing and construction jobs, as well as all “nonsupervisory” workers in service industries such health care or fast food. The group accounts for about four-fifths of the privately employed workers in America, according to BLS.\n\n----------\n\nArticle title: Worker wages drop while companies spend billions to boost stocks\n\nDate: 07/11/18\n\nLink:\ngoogle: cbsnews /news/worker-wages-drop-while-companies-spend-billions-to-boost-stocks/\n\nExcerpt:\n\n…”\nSix months after the Tax Cut and Jobs Act became law, there's still little evidence that the average job holder is feeling the benefit.\n\nWorker pay in the second quarter dropped nearly one percent below its first-quarter level, according to the PayScale Index, one measure of worker pay. When accounting for inflation, the drop is even steeper. Year-over-year, rising prices have eaten up still-modest pay gains for many workers, with the result that real wages fell 1.4 percent from the prior year, according to PayScale. The drop was broad, with 80 percent of industries and two-thirds of metro areas affected.\n\n… Businesses are spending nearly $700 billion on repurchasing their own stock so far this year, according to research from TrimTabs. Corporations set a record in Q2, announcing $433 billion worth of buybacks — nearly doubling the previous record, which was set in Q1. …”\n\nSee also:\n\ngoogle: ign /boards/threads/real-wages-are-in-decline-while-corporate-profits-soar-after-the-gop-tax-cuts.455165599/\n\ngoogle: nytimes /2018/07/13/business/economy/wages-workers-profits.html\n\ngoogle: dollarsandsense /archives/2004/0904econ.html\n\n----------","reactions":{"total":{"$numberInt":"0"}},"author":"AW Sylwester","profile":"https://mobile.facebook.com/aw.sylwester.5"}

I REFRAINED FROM THAT because I felt it was CRUEL to talk that way when so many people are suffering beyond belief. (I've had my home threatened in a natural disaster, and I know HOW IT FEELS.) Now is a time to emphasize A GOD WHO ANSWERS PRAYER, WHO PROVIDES COMFORT AND PROVISION, AND WHO SAVES PEOPLE FROM THEIR SINS (IF THEY WOULD TURN TO HIM THROUGH FAITH IN JESUS). What about Harvey? Why did it happen? IT'S A BIRTHPANG AMONG BIRTHPANGS, WHICH ARE INDEED INCREASING IN SEVERITY. GOD WANTS PEOPLE TO SEEK REFUGE IN HIM THROUGH JESUS BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE.]\n\nNOW, HERE IS AMIR'S COMMENTARY:\n\nHurricane Harvey, the most powerful and devastating hurricane to hit the United States in over a decade, has been nothing short of a catastrophe. Hundreds of thousands have been displaced, homes and lives uprooted and 38 casualties from the storm.\n\nWhile there is no doubt that Hurricane Harvey is a horrible natural disaster, we must remember that it’s part of a global phenomena of natural disasters and sadly many aren’t getting any media coverage at all. Floods in many parts of Asia, famines in large parts of Africa and Yemen and record number of earthquakes worldwide are hardly getting any attention anymore.\n\nThis morning, at least 7 were killed when a building collapsed in Mumbai due to heavy flooding. The coastal city of over 20 million has been the most recent affected by storms during the height of the monsoon season. The floods have killed over 1,200 in India, Bangladesh and Nepal, displacing thousands.\n\nSuch intensity of natural disasters is exactly what Romans 8:22-24 is talking about. These are clearly the birth pangs before the soon redemption of our body (the Rapture).\n\n“…22 For we know that the whole creation groans and labors with birth pangs together until now. 23 Not only that, but we also who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, eagerly waiting for the adoption, the redemption of our body. 24 For we were saved in this hope, but hope that is seen is not hope; for why does one still hope for what he sees?…”\n\nIn my opinion, associating Harvey with the “peace process” in Israel (which is no longer a “big deal” to anyone in the region anymore) is stretching it to unwanted places.\n\nThe association of every devastating natural disaster in America to Israel not only isn’t accurate, but can indirectly promote a very wrong picture of God and His Word. As if Israel is more important to Him than the unborn etc. Think of the lay Christian who can’t bear anymore, the unrighteousness all around him, yet is being told that God acts in judgment only when the future of the land of Israel is at stake?\n\nBeing familiar with the negotiating process in the Middle East, Trump’s Administration is the friendliest we have ever had since Nixon. The two-state solution is an old idea offered by the UN in the 1940’s. Since 1967, Israel itself has been offering the Palestinians land for peace. Way before we had even one single settlement in Judea, Samaria, Gaza or the Golan Heights, the Arabs refused to any solution that would allow a vibrant Jewish state to remain standing.\n\nAs an insider, I can tell you that Prime Minister Netanyahu is getting what he wants from the current American team. The ideas being presented to the Palestinians today by Kushner are ideas that were promoted by Netanyahu himself. No one in Israel- or in the whole region- seriously believes that the Palestinians will ever accept those ideas anyway. As long as we don’t agree on Jerusalem, borders or refugees, nothing will ever move forward.\n\nLast December, the UN Security Council adopted a landmark resolution demanding a halt to all Israeli settlement in “the occupied territories” after Barack Obama’s Administration refused to veto the resolution. The vote didn’t exclude Jerusalem’s Old City as part of the “occupied territories” thus suggesting that the Western Wall, the Jewish Quarter and the Temple Mount aren’t Israel’s legal territory. The vote that was no doubt Obama’s last revenge on Israel was far more “punishment worthy” than anything Trump has ever done.\n\nSo why does Hurricane Harvey happen now and not then?\n\nIf anything, I believe that America as a nation may one day be judged by God, but surely not for Jared Kushner’s visit to Israel. It’s about much more important things that America has been doing against God and His Word such as the heavy promotion of killing the unborn, sexual immorality, redefining marriage and family, divorce, idolatry, worship of mammon, allowing Satan worship, mocking Jesus while protecting Allah, etc.\n\nIsaiah 5:20\n\n“…Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!..”\n\nAwaiting His Return,\nAmir","reactions":{"total":{"$numberInt":"0"}},"author":"Dora Torpey","profile":"https://mobile.facebook.com/dora.torpey.3551"}

Donald Trump has neither the capacity nor the intelligence nor the aspiration to lead this nation, to honor its Constitution, to represent its citizens.

He doesn’t lose sleep over disabled veterans or coal miners or single mother or suicidal teenagers. He has no interest in dignity or decency or nobility befitting the Office—not because, as his supporters say he is a “straight shooting Washington outsider”—but because America is nothing but another host to him.\n\nAs always, he is here solely to slap his name on something and to suck it all dry—and if your eyes are open you can see that he is doing that right now.\n\nhttps://johnpavlovitz.com/2017/12/21/bankrupting-casino-country/?utm_campaign=coschedule&utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=johnpavlovitz","reactions":{"like":{"$numberInt":"1"},"love":{"$numberInt":"1"},"total":{"$numberInt":"2"}},"author":"David Schroeder","profile":"https://mobile.facebook.com/david.schroeder.1257"}

Your fence means nothing for security. Her point was there are many famous actors and actresses who want open borders but live in gated communities with guards. When asked why they simply state they want to feel secure. Ok. Then why can't all Americans have the same feeling of security? Those who live close to the border know far more than you or I and they do not feel safe as they so often have said in news clips from all news outlets. The people who are caravaning in have been mobilized there by far leftists and some have said they were paid to come. Why don't the elite people open their gates and live like the rest of us do? You know there are gated communities with guards but don't you want a safer country? The immigration laws were written and passed by Democrats during the Clinton administration and all presidents since have adhered to this law. The people who sneak in have abandoned thousands of children at the border and all president have moved them into custody until they can either be reunited or brought back home. These policies have never changed. barry was responsible for over 90K children who were dumped there. Every president since and including Clinton has said they wanted to build a wall and now Trump is getting attacked for saying the exact same thing. Why? Both Pelosi and Schummer voted FOR a wall in 06' Why are they against it now? Why are you against it?

Trumplethinskin, as you call him has done more for this nation, than your Oscumbag president did in his entire 8 year reign of terror!! Here’s a great idea, if you want all these illegal asshole’s in this country, why don’t you invite them to live with you and your hubby? You sure sound like you are welcoming this vermin in our country, and if you want them here, you take responsibility for them!! How’s that sound? Why is it so hard for all you Democraps to understand the devistation and after math of these illegal bastards once they arrive here!! Are all you people this stupid!! Not to mention the untreatable Diseases these people will have that they will share with you and every other American, and the increased drug flow across the borders, and the increased medical and food costs that will be caused by this invasion! But, getting back to the basis for these statements, I say to you, THEY DONT BELONG HERE!!! They are, and I quote, “ILLEGALS!!!” That means, in case you don’t know, they are not legal to be here!!! That’s not to hard to understand, is it!! We have immigration laws, and they are there for a reason!!! You can’t figure this out for yourself? Why would you even think they deserve a free ride across our border? I tell you what, Grant is it, why don’t you waltz your ass down to the Mexican / American border and welcome all of them to jump in your vehicle and you can take all of them to you and your MAN’S place and you and he can take care of all of them!! Don’t like that idea? Then stop supporting these bastards getting here!!! You don’t want to feed them and take responsibility for them? Well, guess what Einstein, we don’t want to either!!

Mueller just torched the dumb-as-sh** spin that Flynn had been tricked into lying.\n\nThey just pointed the court to evidence that Flynn had already asserted the same falsehoods to the press before even being asked.--Mueller's office has responded to claims by Gen. Flynn's lawyers that the FBI might have tricked him into lying to them. Basically, prosecutors say that by the time agents talked to him, he'd been lying to everybody for two weeks.\nMueller's office says that Flynn, then the national security officer and a retired general, \"does not need to be warned it is a crime to lie to federal agents to know the importance of telling them the truth.\"\nAnd Mueller's office says Flynn continued lying to DOJ after his White House interview. He \"made those false statements while represented by counsel and after receiving an explicit warning that providing false information was a federal offense.\"\nMueller's office says Flynn actually seemed to be pretty good at lying.\n\nAnd prosecutors say his lies raise \"the question of why he was lying to the FBI, the Vice President, and others.\"","reactions":{"total":{"$numberInt":"0"}},"author":"Carl Ostendarp","profile":"https://mobile.facebook.com/carl.ostendarp"}

If this happens then the US companies will crash the world economy by price gouging medicine. People can’t pay you what they don’t have.

Donald Trump has neither the capacity nor the intelligence nor the aspiration to lead this nation, to honor its Constitution, to represent its citizens.

He doesn’t lose sleep over disabled veterans or coal miners or single mother or suicidal teenagers. He has no interest in dignity or decency or nobility befitting the Office—not because, as his supporters say he is a “straight shooting Washington outsider”—but because America is nothing but another host to him.\n\nAs always, he is here solely to slap his name on something and to suck it all dry—and if your eyes are open you can see that he is doing that right now.\n\nhttps://johnpavlovitz.com/2017/12/21/bankrupting-casino-country/?utm_campaign=coschedule&utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=johnpavlovitz","reactions":{"total":{"$numberInt":"0"}},"author":"David Schroeder","profile":"https://mobile.facebook.com/david.schroeder.1257"}

If history is an indicator I’m not sure he or his family members will be in solidarity. I mean 50 years later we learned about Nixon’s corrupt treasonous deeds and he never went to prison. Nixon purposely interfered with peace negotiations to end the Vietnam war which caused an additional 20,000 US soldiers to die. Nixon also orchestrated the assignation of the Democratically elected president of Chile on September 11, 1973. And then replaced him with a murdering tyrant who Nixon could control. I’m suffering from whiplash learning about all the crimes committed by these corrupt government officials who never went to prison.

All Trump is saying is that he has no problems with people coming in as long as they use the door and do it according to the law. The problem is that the media has inflated it so much that even the so called asylum seekers are now asking for a ransom payment in the sum of 50,000$ each to turn around and go home (you can’t make this stuff up). I’m not an American nor do I live in America but logic tells me that if your government would allow everyone to come in your country will look like France in no time, don’t you want to live in a safer country? I have compassion for asylum seeker but I cry when I see an innocent girl getting raped and killed in the most brutal way by someone who snuck into the country got deported and was let back in like 4-5 times, where is the compassion for her and her family?

I am somewhat bemused though...\nNow, on your FB page, you do indeed seem to show support for the IDF. Now, I can recall during the Gaza war just how proactive that organisation was in disseminating propaganda for that cause, it definitely used social media accounts. I have yet to meet a Canadian, who like me live on crown territory, to give such blind support for Donald Trump. Reason being, is unlike living within the US you can see things more impartially from outside.\n\nNow, I'd say that DT has indeed family links not only to Russians, but Jewish too..\n\nI think maybe that's where you come in, correct?\n\nThanks for reading.","reactions":{"like":{"$numberInt":"1"},"total":{"$numberInt":"1"}},"author":"Taylor Johnson","profile":"https://mobile.facebook.com/profile.php"}

You used to lose almost 100 billion every year with the previous deal, with the new deal you won’t be losing nothing, now that you have a masters degree you can use your mathematical skills and answer the question of how much is the wall costing? 25 billion? How much is America gaining from the New Mexican deal? 100 billion? Furthermore you’re paying almost 80 billion dollars a year to host all the illegals in your country the wall will stop the overflow it works it’s not just a wall it’s a whole system in some areas it’s just a fence backed up by sensors and other utilities. It’s for your safety I don’t understand why you’re so against it. Well I do understand why you hate Trump more than you love your country you’re pathetic you’re making an ass of yourself by demonizing your president he’s not even my president and I have to defend him? How dumb are you? Seriously did you lie about your masters degree or do you have your head so far up your ass that you can’t see what’s happening around you?

Hamas wants to kill all the Jews (I’m sure you’d love that) and all the Christians in israel this is their goal that’s why they are there occupying Jewish lands in Gaza and Judea & Samaria known to you as “The West Bank” biggest lie in history but it’s easy and comfortable for you to believe it because of your blind hate to Israel and Jews.

(Not the American people. That’s why we shouldn’t fund it. And in a previous post I gave a ton of reasons why a wall won’t work.)\nI have to say I don’t fully understand the conflict in the Middle East but I do understand now the coup of 1953 in Iran. Which was finally available to every American in 2011. I’ll tell you this that knowledge of facts gives us all the power to make better decisions in the future.\n\nI will tell you that in our schools back in the 1980’s and 1990’s I was taught that the Middle East conflict has been over religion. And the religious buildings of worship that are valuable to both the Jewish and Muslims. Over time I have become less religious. I think religion is fake. It’s a tool used by some organizations to manipulate people into pushing their agenda.\nI for one don’t want a genocide to occur for any group of people. “Ethnic cleansing” is an idea made up by psychopaths. If you are manipulated into hurting people or children then you’re on the wrong side.\n\nI may not know every fact about the conflict over there but I do have a strong sense of morality. And the people that I have met of any ethnic culture also have the same sense of morality. All they want to live peacefully, be able to work and provide for their families, give their children a good life, set their children up so they can have a bright future.\nI want all of those things too.\nIf you are on the side of someone who promotes hurting children then I’m sorry my friend, but you are on the wrong side. I would never support someone who hurts your children on your side of the world. I’m sooo sick and tired of the war and chaos. I do care about your children and I care about the poor children in Syria that are starving to death. Don’t you? What kind of world do you want to live in????

I don't know the man, but I do respect his ability to emerge from the Holocaust and build a successful business all on his own.

He is a man with strong views, some of which I would challange, however, he is committed to his beliefs and does much more than hang out on Facebook - behind his words are works. What have you actually physically done lately to support your views?\n\nFor the record - your cutting and pasting a novel does not support your accusations about domestic terrorism. Soros is many things but there is zero evidence to support he is or ever has been a terrorist. He survived horrors that no man should have to endure.\n\nAnd, James, if the choice is between George Soros and Milo Yiannopoulos, the Nazi Republicians poster boy, I will go with Soros every time.\n\nAre you aware you can get free dental work?

That percentage will likely increase. What about the cost of immigration courts? They already have several years of back-logged cases. Then there are all the costs associated with crimes committed by non-citizens.

Build the wall and stop the drugs, criminals, diseased people, and welfare recipients from coming in and over time Mexico will pay for it. They simply can not afford to not trade fairly with us.

If you wish to send capable youth out of this country, you are 1) choosing an immoral path 2) very short sighted about what is good for the country and its future 3) ignore what is bad for the country and its reputation. If you look at the border security statistics in an objective manner, it is abundantly clear that a Trump-style wall is not the answer. A good system of patrol, technology and a basic deterrents have been very effective at apprehending and deterring border crossings in the past. In 1992, the border patrol reported arrested more than 560,000 immigrants attempting to cross into the U.S. illegally in the 60-mile San Diego sector, for example. Numbers fell as a clear deterrent was set in place. Manning the border also employs more workers long term, where the wall is not nearly as effective, disrupts private lands, and can be tunneled under or climbed over. For the billions we spend on a ineffective wall, we could keep families at work and do a better job, and have money left over for better education and other infrastructure. Lastly, our foreign policy is lacking immensely right now and working with the struggling countries that are leading to migrant and asylum influx would do quite a bit to keep people in their homelands (which almost everyone involved would prefer in the end).","reactions":{"total":{"$numberInt":"0"}},"author":"Isaac Nelson","profile":"https://mobile.facebook.com/isdnelson"}

If you check out getting a HMO with that kind of deductible and co pays may not cost anymore than Obamacare.

There are places where a wall will be useful and there are places where it is financially more feasible and more common sense to use technology! Trump doesn't care about the people of this country. He cares that he is not getting his ego fed by wasting millions of tax payer dollars! Has nothing to do with safety. Just like the huge carravan coming right at mid terms that poof, disappeared and was never heard from the minute they were over. Some people are simply gullible and naive, some are slow learners and some are simply unable to come up against a reality tv show producer and see things for exactly what they are! Think about it!

It's not grade school math where there are numbers, they are always the same, and simple majorityies decide questions. The margin off their control of both houses was very small. 1 or 2 rogue republicans - and there is almost always 1 or 2 who either are making a power play to get something else, or who, rarely, actually vote their conscience - could sink a vote. And simple majorities don't decide many issues. Add to that the fact that the opposing party, even when it is in the minority, can still slow dow, sabotage, or outright stop all kinds of things with procedural issues or efforts to swing public opinions and votes. Bioth parties, when in the minority, have slowed down or stopped many things for no reason other than they are the opposition. So please, stop attempting to apply a generic talking point that isn't even accurate","reactions":{"total":{"$numberInt":"0"}},"author":"James Nyland","profile":"https://mobile.facebook.com/james.nyland.5"}

Bush did better than his republican predecessors, but still fell a bit short.\n\nEven President Bill Clinton came under fire from women’s organizations for his shortcomings on delivering a cabinet that “looks like America.”\n\nThe unattainable feat?\n\nHiring an astounding number of women for senior-level positions in the White House.\n\nLuckily for women everywhere, in 2018 it has finally been accomplished.\n\nNaturally, Vogue has written about it. Cosmopolitan has shouted it from the rooftops, as has MSNBC and every other liberal news outlet.\n\nIf only that last part were true.\n\nDespite impressive hiring practices during his first year in the White House, President Donald Trump has received little to no credit for his choice of women for the most senior positions on his cabinet, as well as the West Wing.\n\nIn fact, the mainstream media only selectively reported on the male appointees of the Trump administration, claiming that he was appointing “more white and male than any first cabinet since Reagan.” This myth was perpetuated by Rep. Nancy Pelosi’s (D-Calif.) comments as well as media reports that Trump only valued the opinions of “guys named Steve.”\n\nThe New York Times even reported on Jan. 13, 2017 — a full week before Trump even took the oath of office or set foot in the oval office — that he apparently preferred men over women for senior roles.\n\nSo, why have the mainstream media given him no credit? Why haven’t the glossy magazines – who pride themselves on empowering women in the workplace — given him credit where credit is due? If Hillary Clinton were president, they would be touting her accomplishments.\n\nThe answer is because Trump is a republican. It’s accurate to state that he is just not their guy.\n\nHow can one prove this?\n\nOnly seven percent of journalists recently identified as republican during the last presidential election cycle; that’s right, ninety-three percent of journalists said they were not republican in 2015. Compare this number to 1992 when the New York Times reported that just 44 percent of journalists claimed to be democrats.\n\nThe Center for Public Integrity also revealed through its analysis of the 2016 elections that journalists “overwhelmingly donated” to Hillary Clinton. So much for independently refereeing the match.\n\nHowever, just because Trump doesn’t receive credit for his hiring of women doesn’t mean it’s any less significant.\n\nHis list of female appointees is long: Nikki Haley, Ambassador to the United Nations (not only a woman but also child of Indian American Sikh immigrants); Elaine Chao, Secretary of Transportation; Kirstjen Nielsen, Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security; Dr. Heather Wilson, Secretary of the Air Force; Sarah Sanders, White House Press Secretary; Kellyanne Conway, Counselor to the President; Linda McMahon, Administrator of the U.S. Small Business Administration; Betsy DeVos, Secretary of Education; Jovita Carranza, U.S. Treasurer (also a minority and first-generation Mexican American immigrant); Neomi Rao, Regulation Czar (also a minority and daughter of parents from India); Seema Verma, Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (also a minority); Heather Brand, Associate Attorney General; Kelly Sadler, Director of Surrogate & Coalitions Outreach; Mercedes Schlapp, Senior Communications Advisor (also a minority whose father was once a political prisoner of Fidel Castro); Ivanka Trump, Advisor to the President; Hope Hicks, Communications Director; Jessica Ditto, Deputy Director of Communications; and Dina Powell, Deputy National Security Adviser who according to White House sources will remain in her position through the end of January and will likely be replaced by another woman after Powell completes her first year in office.","reactions":{"total":{"$numberInt":"0"}},"author":"Terrie Bush-Sabrowski","profile":"https://mobile.facebook.com/terrie.bushsabrowski.1"}

There simply is no debate. Trump is doing what is needed and the Democrats are dangerous. Many Republicans are also dangerous. The fact is, our government has become dangerous. They validate what they are doing simply by saying that they think it is a good idea. No logic, no facts, no common sense. President Trump has brought back reason and common sense. The numbers prove it, the opinions, comments and fears from the leaders of other nations prove it. People who mimic the common news media are irrelevant due to the fact that they have succumb to the Democratic propaganda machine, just as most of the German population did under Nazi rule. Goebbels took control of ALL media; papers, radio, movies. He fed them one side, just as the current media does, and eventually, the weak minded begin mimicking this dogma. Please Google this topic. You will actually find the exact same thing being spoken on every channel of news. To be fair, this is being done on both sides of the aisle, so this is something to fear. Please do not believe what you hear on TV until you do fact checking yourself, or simply assume they are ALL lying. Don't listen, look. Is your 401K growing, are there more jobs, etc., get a short wave and try the BBC.

Obama had this highest unemployment rate (Trump has the Lowest unemployment rate) Obama down sizes our military, cut space program (Trump increased our military and space program) Obama gave billions to our enemies ( Trump cut that money and put it back into America) Obama did stimulus package for the auto makers and roadway which was Billions of dollars (Trump won't bail them out) Obama sent most of our companies out of America (Trump is beginning them back). All those fact were on all news channels and report in regular newspapers. But you can also find those facts in public records. DO RESEARCH!! Don't be a patsy for the democrats agenda! Nancy Pelosi it worth millions due to all the cut backs she has gotten. Her vineyard, ask her how many immigrants she employees? She is getting rich off of people who want the government to run their lives. I much rather have an adulteress, loud mouth business man in office than some muslim lying bigot who's wife and children took millions of dollar vacation while the America people suffered with no jobs, losing their homes.

Maybe we don't like his misanthropic policies that hurt people of color and people trying to find asylum in the same country where most of our parents/grandparents/great grandparents also did. Maybe it's because he's a cheater having rooked old folks and students in a fake university. Maybe it's because of his unpatriotic derision of virtually every former president and leaders (who were elected by \"we the people\" of all parties). Maybe we don't like his assertion that he and only he is privy to truth and the free media condoned and supported by our Constitution is not real. Maybe we don't like him calling members of an opposing political party un-American (he's the only resident of the White House in our history who, once there, has not spent most of his time trying to bring the country together.) Instead in daily whining, inane, childish tweets he thrives on dividing the country to simply mollify his shrinking base for the sole reason of self protection and self-aggrandizment. Maybe it's because we don't like his tax cuts that gave HIS FAMILY and other one-percenters huge permanent tax cuts while average folks get a small TEMPORARY cut that will be whittled away by inflation. Maybe we don't like that he condones the murder of a journalist working for an American newspaper to be cut to pieces at the word of a vile Saudi Prince against the specific proof by our CIA that the prince ordered the death in their Turkish embassy.

Because this probe has lasted 2 years, been slow and methodically, with lots of great journalism filling in the gaps, we probably know the broad outline of the Trump-Russia conspiracy. Team Trump will wave the lack of a closing \"bombshell\" as a red flag that Mueller failed\n\n3. But what Team Trump is really hoping is that Americans have grown numb to what in fact is the most outrageous electoral conspiracy in U.S. history, whose contours have been revealed to us, drip by drip, over the last two years.\n\n4. Here's the reality we need to come to terms with: Congress and the American people had -- by Trump's first few months in office -- more evidence of criminality against the president than what was used to oust Nixon over Watergate in 1974\n\n5. The \"smoking (or 'smocking') gun\" tape that sunk Nixon and caused Republican leaders to march down Capitol Hill and tell the 37th POTUS to resign was Nixon using his power to derail the FBI and obstruct the probe - exactly what Trump admitted to after he fired Comey\n\n6. And that's in addition to the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting, also more damning than anything we know about the Watergate break-in. Collusion? We've long known the quids (Russian hacking of DNC, \"fake news\" on FB) and quos (RNC platform change, sanctions relief promises).\n\n7. Simply put, some folks are waiting for a \"bombshell\" while a slow-motion demolition of American democracy has taken place right before our eyes. Mueller's final moves could drop a real shocker, but they may not. We need to accept that the real shock is what we already know,\n\n8. That's why the focus needs to shift from what else we're going to learn about Trump-Russia -- we may already know 97 percent of it -- to what Congress and the rest of the establishment will do about the most dangerous conspiracy in our history, already in plain sight\n\n9. The question going forward is whether what we already know -- that a U.S. presidential election was won through fraud, theft, lying, illegal payoffs and other criminal acts -- will have real consequences for the man who stole that election, Donald Trump.\n\n10. If not, we can stop publishing all those books about whether democracy is dying. It will be already long dead.","reactions":{"total":{"$numberInt":"0"}},"author":"Carl Ostendarp","profile":"https://mobile.facebook.com/carl.ostendarp"}

It's a pity you do not speak my Serbian language so that I can explain it better. I'll try it this way -- All these people saying all these bad things about Mister Trump, who's by the way their legitimate President, first of all have nothing to do with common sense and are behaving like a spoiled kids. If they were busy doing something meaningful, they would never be gossiping like some grannies. Second, and most important thing, is that most of them are ridiculous and badly educated, not using their heads and brains at all, plus they all suffering from a chronic lack of domestic education which is their parents' very bad mistake. If they were raised up in a better manner they would never call their President the names. Bottom line! That is so immensely rude and so low, and I am so, angry every time they call Mister Trump an idiot, or this and that name. That is so disgusting. It is so terrible in what ways Mister Trump is humiliated by all of them. What's more they are doing the same with the First Lady and Their Son Baron! What the hell that boy has got to do with politics, this country's policy, Government and all these ugly people, except that the boy is Mr.President's son?!?!? He is nothing but an innocent kid. The attitude of those filthy tongues towards this kid are more than disgusting and so unacceptable. What the hell young Baron has to do with anything for God's sake!?!?! We Serbian people did not want Slobodan Milošević to be our President any more, we stepped out in the streets, were protesting for months and years, but we never were offending Him in any way. So, all this mob is nothing but a plain mass!!! If they were and are capable using their heads they would never listen to all these fake news and lies Don Lemon and others like him are serving to them for months and months every day and night. I will never understand how the hell this \"plain mass\" can't see that they are brainwashing them permanently and intentionally. And, finally the third thing, that is unacceptable and very dangerous is that all this rabble is full of hatred. They've simply stumbled on Mister Trump and His Family, they hate them and Him and nothing can be done about it. That is unfortunately so-called \"river with no return\". This hatred is so deep in them, and part of their everyday lives. It's spreading more and more! Like a worst disease! This hatred is their so-called Modus Vivendi! There is nothing worse than a dissolute mass that hates so much. So much that it made them blind and deaf! The worst thing in all this is that this same hatred is undermining them, the whole system, the society, their lives, and finally their kids' lives and future. America has never been more divided and never at such a low branches! Americans and all of you bad guys - Shake your tormented heads and pull yourselves together! Come to your minds and get recollected while it still is not too late! Get out of the agony! May God help you all!

Back in 2011, conservative commentator and author Ben Shapiro published a book titled “Primetime Propaganda: The True Hollywood Story of How the Left Took Over Your TV” which, according to its description, “is the story – told in their own words – of how television has been used over the past sixty years by Hollywood writers, producers, actors and executives to promote their liberal ideals, to push the envelope on social and political issues, and to shape America in their own leftist image.” As an example, Shapiro notes in his book that Sesame Street has been used many times in the past to advance the progressive agenda. One of the show’s founding executives, a man by the name of Mike Dann, admitted to using Sesame Street to address “conflicts arising from racial and ethnic diversity” and even to highlight peaceful alternatives to war in the weeks and months following the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001. If you put yourself in the shoes of a young person consuming these types of messages, it really isn’t farfetched to argue that this, in and of itself, is a form of liberal mind control.\n\nOf course, it’s not just Sesame Street and Hollywood; indeed, much of this sort of left-wing brainwashing occurs inside of the classroom. Websites like CampusReform.org, TheCollegeFix.com, and of course Natural News routinely report on stories of professors that indoctrinate their students with extreme anti-conservative or pro-liberalism messages. The minds of our young people are being molded to conform to leftist principles, and the vast majority of them don’t even know it.\"","reactions":{"like":{"$numberInt":"1"},"total":{"$numberInt":"1"}},"author":"Mihaila Svetlana Popovich Green","profile":"https://mobile.facebook.com/svetlana.mihaila.5"}

Is it that Democrats Hate American success and/or the swamp being drained?\n\n– OIG Audit Results That You Never Knew Occurred\nAll Departments were Audited and The OIG found criminal misconduct throughout. In The Dept. of Agriculture Alone the Investigations reported 217 arrests, 280 indictments, and 272 convictions, as well as $84.9 million in recoveries and restitution's.\n\n- United States Sanctions Human Rights Abusers and Corrupt Actors Across the Globe\n\n- DOJ Investigates 'Mystery' Goldman Executive Involved In $4.5 Billion 1MDB Fraud\n- MEDIA SILENT WHILE 3,000 ELITE ARRESTED FOR PEDOPHILIA SO FAR THIS YEAR\n- Retired U.S. Army Colonel Charged Bribing Haiti Officials – Clinton Connections\n\n- Trump’s list: 289 accomplishments in just 20 months, ‘relentless’ promise-keeping\n\nBoom: Highest economic optimism in nearly 18 years, 85% doing well\nTrump has led us into 60 record DJI highs, not to mention multiple S&P highs.\nTrump was able to bring us a Growth economy of 4.1.\nUS Treasury Collects ‘RECORD TAX’ Revenue Through August\nOverall unemployment figure, fell below 4 percent for the first time since 2000.\nThe number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment aid fell to near a 49-year low and private payrolls rose steadily in August,\n\nBlack and Hispanic jobless rates are generally more volatile;\n\nBlack unemployment fell to 6.6 percent in April, the lowest in data dating back to 1972\nSMALL BUSINESS OWNERSHIP UP 400% AMONG BLACKS UNDER TRUMP\n\nThere were over 650,000 more blacks working last month - October 2018 than there were in October 2017. Compared with the average monthly numbers of 2016, there were over 1.3 million more blacks working.\n\nHispanics jobless rate dipped to 4.8 percent, matching the lowest on record.\nCensus Bureau: Hispanic Household Income Hits Record High\n\nUS steel industry booming after Trump's tariffs\n\nU.S. manufacturing output increased in October, the Federal Reserve said on Friday. This was the fifth straight monthly output increase.\n\nThere are 6.7 million job openings and just 6.4 million available workers to fill them, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. April marked the second month in a row that there were more vacancies than available hires, a phenomenon that had not happened before 2018.\n\n- Army misses 2018 recruiting goal for first time in 13 years\nThe Army's shortfall, said Maj. Gen. Joe Calloway, was fueled by the strong American economy and increased competition from private sector employers who can pay more. But the failure has triggered an overhaul in Army recruiting, including an increase in recruiters, expanded marketing and a new effort to reach out to young, potential recruits through popular online gaming.\n\n- Donald Trump: King of Deregulation?\nThe government has added an average of 13,000 new restrictions annually for the past 20 years. Under Trump, the number of new regulations is near zero.\nIt’s a reminder that in this distraction-a-minute presidency, it can be useful to distinguish between the person of the president, who has no discernible ideology, and his presidency, which, so far, has been strikingly conservative.\n\nConstraining the administrative state is a founding principle of modern conservatism, which holds that economic freedom is necessary to political freedom. Trump’s stated objective is prosperity, which is not unrelated, and there is much evidence (besides the intuitive) of a negative correlation between restrictive regulation and economic growth. A 2013 study published in the Journal of Economic Growth found that accumulated regulations between 1949 and 2005 slowed the American economy by an annual average of 2 percent. One of McLaughlin’s studies estimates that the cumulative effect of government regulation caused the economy to be $4 trillion smaller in 2012 than it might have been. “That amount equaled about a quarter of the U.S. economy in 2012, and if it were a nation’s GDP, it would be the fourth largest in the world,” he wrote.\n\n- Income Tax Revenues Are Up 9% This Year — Is Trump Tax Cut Paying For Itself?\nFor the fiscal year as a whole — which started last October — all federal revenues are up by $31 billion. That's a 1.2% in increase over last year, the CBO says.\nThe Treasury Department, which issues a separate monthly report, says it expects federal revenues will continue to exceed last year's for the rest of the 2018 fiscal year.\nBut wait a minute. According to Democrats, the Trump tax cuts were supposed to blow a massive hole in the deficit.\n\n- Spending Cuts to Expired and Unnecessary Programs Act – fail\nYEAs 48 All republicans - NAYs 50 All Democrats 2 Republicans\n\n- Feds Collect Record Taxes in October; Still Run $100B Deficit\n(CNSNewscom) - The federal government collected record total tax revenues of $252,692,000,000 in October, the first month of fiscal 2019, according to the Monthly Treasury Statement released Tuesday.\nDespite the record tax collections, the government still ran a deficit of $100,491,000,000 for the month—because it spent $353,183,000,000.\nThis October’s record $252,692,000,000 in total tax collections was $11,414,590,000 more than the $241,277,410,000 (in constant October 2018 dollars) that the federal government collected in October 2017, which was the previous record for federal tax collections in October.\nCorporation income tax receipts, however, were significantly higher this October than they were in October 2017. This year, the Treasury collected $8,000,000,000 in corporation income taxes in October. Last year, it collected $3,823,060,000 (in constant October 2018 dollars).\n\nNo, The Trump Tax Cuts Did Not All Go To “The Rich”\nhttps://bongino.com/no-the-trump-tax-cuts-did-not-all-go-to-the-rich/","reactions":{"total":{"$numberInt":"0"}},"author":"Christine Spatafore","profile":"https://mobile.facebook.com/christine.d.poulin"}

Nothing worse than talking tough in front of the whole world and then not having the courage to back it up. Remember when he promised to renegotiate NAFTA 50 times when on the campaign trail, but in 8 years never did that either? Not to worry - Trump took care of that and for the first time there are wage protection clauses in place to encourage Automotive Companies in Mexico to pay a better wage to avoid tariffs. Remember when Obama saddled a broken economy with 22,000 pages of regulations between the ACA and the Dodd-Frank act? Condemning the USA to an annual average 1.6% GDP (historical annual average 3%), for his 8 year term. Never made the 3% annual average once in 8 years... Ahhh the good old days of sub-par economic performance!! Especially pathetic when you consider he took over the economy at the 2nd lowest point in history with no where to go but up. Even the Great Depression had 5/10 years of 5+ GDP. And how about when all the young healthy adults without healthcare, many of whom voted for Obama, chose to pay the fine rather than sign up for healthcare they didn't need thereby removing one of the main sources of revenue to support the ACA. You know what they say about other people's money: Its not yours - its theirs - so don't count on spending it. And speaking of the ACA remember when Obama pushed back the implementation of the\"cadillac tax\" another source of revenue for the ACA, because it upset people with good healthcare plans and those people vote! And speaking of breaking laws remember when Obama ordered the IRS to investigate conservative organizations, illegally? The IRS issued a formal apology afterwards. And how about when he funded the ACA illegally, moving monies to insurance companies so they wouldn't drop out of the ACA. Trump put an end to that illegal funding. And how about that Guns for Drugs scandal - selling weapons to the cartels! What a wild and crazy guy that Obama was!! 😂😂 Oh and how about ISIS?? You know the \"JV Team\" (as per Obama) that murdered and pillaged their way across Iraq and Syria killing tens of thousands of people. I can see how you could forget about them, haven't heard much about them lately. Maybe because since Trump took office they have had their territory reduced by 85% and are on the run. Yes. I am giving thanks for a President who says what he does, and does what he says. #MAGA","reactions":{"total":{"$numberInt":"0"}},"author":"Mike Wisniewski","profile":"https://mobile.facebook.com/mike.wisniewski.7"}

Start by knowing the law of your own country, so that no president can dupe you. A president whose population does not know it's own law might as well be a king, and then why did we bother with our revolution?\n\nIn this case, read 8 U.S.C. 1158. Donald wants you to think asylum seekers are not allowed on US soil, or are not allowed to apply for asylum after having first seen to their own safety. But the thrice-married cheat lies, big surprise. Read the law for yourself, and then ask our president to respect Article I versus Article II power separation as set out by our Constitution - it is only via Congress that the law may be changed.\n\nRepublicans have had control of Congress for two years now. If they wanted to change 8 U.S.C. to consider a toddler meandering across the boarder to be an enemy combatant, they could have. But they didn't, so 8 U.S.C. 1158 stands, which permits asylum seekers to apply anywhere in our country, and not only at official ports of entry. It says that in black and white, there is no ambiguity.","reactions":{"like":{"$numberInt":"1"},"total":{"$numberInt":"1"}},"author":"Ben Mord","profile":"https://mobile.facebook.com/ben.mord"}

There are 4 standouts, see if you notice a pattern with the parties…all Republicans!!\n\nRichard Nixon — Republican. Ever heard of Watergate? The scandal that became so synonymous with scandal that “gate” is now affixed to anything remotely scandal like. Nixon had to resign and was only saved from prison by a pardon from his hand picked successor. 69 government officials were charged with crimes. This includes his Chief of Staff and multiple members of his cabinet — as high level as it gets. Of course, this was only after his original Vice President was convicted for an unrelated crime (tax evasion — but it was a settlement related to allegedly “accepting more than $100,000 in bribes”) All Republicans.\n\nRonald Reagan — Republican. Ever heard of Iran-Contra? Many high level indictments, including the Secretary of Defense, the Assistant Secretary of State, and two National Security Advisors. Presidents Reagan and Bush claimed they didn’t know anything, though people involved said they did. I only say indictments because Bush pardoned 6 of them before the trials were done. “The presidency of Ronald Reagan in the United States was marked by multiple scandals, resulting in the investigation, indictment, or conviction of over 138 administration officials, the largest number for any U.S. president.”\n\nGeorge W. Bush — Republican. Too many scandals to name. More than a dozen members of the Bush administration pleaded guilty to federal crimes. Dozens more resigned under dishonorable circumstances, including his Attorney General, White House Counsel, and other senior members of the administration.\n\nWarren G. Harding — Republican. Ever hear of the Teapot Dome Scandal? Before Watergate, Teapot Dome was regarded as the \"greatest and most sensational scandal in the history of American politics.\" It was a bribery scandal that sent the Attorney General and Interior Secretary to prison. Other Harding corruption scandals were also the stuff of legend, including one where senior officials got caught defrauding the government, fled the country, resigned, and committed suicide.","reactions":{"like":{"$numberInt":"3"},"haha":{"$numberInt":"1"},"total":{"$numberInt":"4"}},"author":"Barbara Balding Garlic","profile":"https://mobile.facebook.com/barbara.b.garlic"}

For the second time in a single year, the unemployment rate among black Americans fell to a record low of 5.9 percent in November as the U.S. economy continues to grow at a remarkable rate.\n\nRates haven’t been this low since the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) began tracking unemployment among ethnic groups in 1972. In fact, based on the shrinking employment gap between black workers and the rest of the labor force, economists have good reason to suspect that the current unemployment rate among African-Americans is the lowest ever experienced....The latest figures show that the overall unemployment rate remains at 3.7 percent for the third month in a row....During his victory speech in November 2016, Trump promised to “be president for all Americans,” and so far, he seems to be on track. Thanks to the GOP tax reform bill, 90 percent of wage earners have experienced higher take-home pay since he took office, and employers are now increasing wages at rates not experienced since before the recession.","reactions":{"total":{"$numberInt":"0"}},"author":"Karen Turner","profile":"https://mobile.facebook.com/karen.turner.5055"}

Conducted by the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), a Washington D.C. nonprofit dedicated to studying immigration issues, the in-depth probe reveals that state and local taxpayers get stuck with an overwhelming chunk—$116 billion—of the burden. State and local expenditures for services provided to illegal aliens total $88.9 billion and federal expenditures $45.8 billion, the analysis found. For those who claim illegal immigrants contribute by paying taxes, government figures show that only $19 billion was recouped by Uncle Sam.\n\n“A continually growing population of illegal aliens, along with the federal government’s ineffective efforts to secure our borders, present significant national security and public safety threats to the United States,” the FAIR report states. “They also have a severely negative impact on the nation’s taxpayers at the local, state, and national levels. Illegal immigration costs Americans billions of dollars each year. Illegal aliens are net consumers of taxpayer-funded services and the limited taxes paid by some segments of the illegal alien population are, in no way, significant enough to offset the growing financial burdens imposed on U.S. taxpayers by massive numbers of uninvited guests.” This defies a myth, long promoted by influential open border groups, that illegal aliens pay their fair share of taxes....","reactions":{"total":{"$numberInt":"0"}},"author":"Karen Turner","profile":"https://mobile.facebook.com/karen.turner.5055"}

In 2014, for the first time in more than 20 years, over 50% of the illegal aliens crossing our 1,940-mile southwest border came from countries other than Mexico–and total cross-border traffic is expanding as well. Over 485,000 people were apprehended in 2014, and if you use the government’s “Gotaway Ratio” of 1.5 successful evasions of the Border Patrol for every single apprehension, the number of illegal entries by foreign nationals in 2015 was over 700,000.What do we know about the diseases carried by illegal aliens? Not much thanks to government secrecy, but we know enough to be worried.\n\nA February 2015 report of the Southern Medical Association cautioned that, since none of the 700,000 illegal entries have been screened for infectious diseases, “Illegal immigration may expose Americans to diseases that have been virtually eradicated but are highly contagious, as in the case of TB.” The association concluded that despite the efforts of the CDC, “There’s a growing health concern over illegal immigrants bringing infectious diseases into the United States.\n\nA year ago, the head of the Texas state medical association called for a quarantine of children arriving at the border from Central America. Instead, the Obama administration ordered the processing of the children to be expedited.In fact, such health concerns have persisted for over a decade and were identified in papers published between 2002 and 2006 by Dr. Madeleine Cosman. Dr. Cosman warned that, “Horrendous diseases that long ago America had conquered are resurging … [and] suddenly are reappearing in American emergency rooms and medical offices.”\n\nAmong the most common diseases found among illegal immigrants are the new multi-drug resistant Tuberculosis (MDR-TB), Chagas Disease, Leprosy, and Dengue Fever...","reactions":{"total":{"$numberInt":"0"}},"author":"Karen Turner","profile":"https://mobile.facebook.com/karen.turner.5055"}

Of that number, 97 percent are illegal aliens. 66 percent of cited drivers in New Mexico have no license, no insurance and no registration for the vehicle. Of that 66 percent, 98 percent are illegal aliens.[15]\n\nThe numbers don’t show attitude or intent. “United States is stupid … I come back every time,” asserted Mexican national Rolando Mota-Campos to a Virginia-based immigration agent after his 11th arrest — for crimes ranging from abduction, assault, four DUIs, vehicular assault, attempted robbery, and domestic violence. Mota-Campos has been deported three times and has vowed to return again.[16]\n\nAnd the numbers don’t show the depth of depravity of some illegal alien criminals. In Arizona, Mexican national Santana Batiz Aceves was charged with 47 counts of rape based on DNA evidence. He has already been deported twice for drug charges in California. Aceves also faces charges of kidnapping, aggravated assault, sexual abuse of a minor, giving police false information, providing false documents, and trespassing.[17]\n\nThe statistics are traumatic, but the anecdotal stories are horrifying.\n\nA year after Baltimore’s mayor signed an order officially converting the city into a sanctuary for illegal immigrants, federal authorities arrested an undocumented Ecuadorian national wanted for the brutal rape of a nine-year-old girl.[18]\n\nCarlos Martinelly-Montano, a Bolivian national who killed a Virginia nun in a drunk-driving accident, was on a new federal government supervised release program, allowing the illegal alien — who committed a series of crimes — to remain on the streets despite being subject to deportation. Rather than detaining Montano, authorities determined that he was a candidate for the Alternatives to Detention (ATD) program, which supposedly monitored his whereabouts..","reactions":{"total":{"$numberInt":"0"}},"author":"Karen Turner","profile":"https://mobile.facebook.com/karen.turner.5055"}

That was why Obama never allowed a real budget so he could keep funnelling money to his Muslim and Terrorist friends!

BTW, Mark Levine is a top Constitutional Law person and he said on the record that a sitting President cannot be indicted.

Unfortunately, it is impossible to know the full meaning of Greenberg’s findings. “Metabolic imbalance” is a catch\n-all phrase for different conditions and, in itself, is equivalent of a\ndiagnosis of “heart problem.” There are\nelectrolyte insufficiencies,\n\nanaerobic imbalances, acid imbalances, and an assortment of related disorders that can have serious health consequences. According to a 2007 peer-reviewed study in the American Journal of Managed Care, patients with underlying mental illnesses have a higher incidence of this syndrome. During the campaign, Trump released a letter from Dr. Harold Bornstein stating that he had been the then-\ncandidate’s\nphysician since 1980 and that there had been no significant medical problems throughout that time. The letter did not reveal that Trump had a second doctor during that time who had diagnosed him with a potentially serious condition. The medical records and interviews with former officials with the Trump Organization reveal that Greenberg gave Trump a prescription for amphetamine derivatives in 1982 to treat his metabolic problem; the records show that Trump continued taking the drugs for a number of years and the former officials said that Trump stopped using them in 1990 at the latest. The derivatives were diethylpropion, known under its brand name as tenuate dospan. These drugs are designed for short-term use; studies have concluded that patients can avoid developing a dependence on the drug if they take it for 25 weeks or less. But Trump continued downing the pills for years. According to two people\n–\nsomeone who said Trump would consider him a friend and a former Trump executive\n–\nthe then-real estate developer boasted that the diethylpropion gave him enormous energy and helped him concentrate. A former Trump executive claimed to have picked up the medication while running errands for the boss. This person said the prescription, for 75 milligrams of diethylpropion a day, was filled at least for a time at a Duane Reade drugstore on 57\nth\nStreet in Manhattan, a few blocks from Trump Tower. The executive said, like many celebrities, Trump used an alias for the prescription. According to the Toxicology Data Network at the National Institutes of Health, diethylpropion has a high risk of dependency and chronic abuse\n–\nsuch as taking it for years\n–\ncan cause delusions, paranoia, and hyperactivity. Studies in medical journals also report it can result in sleeplessness and impulse control problems, characteristics Trump demonstrated throughout the campaign and in the weeks since his inauguration. Hope Hicks, a White House spokeswoman, acknowledged that Trump used them as diet pills for a few days in the early 1980s. However, the medical records contradict the assertion of the length of time Trump used the drugs and photographs of Trump from 1982 show him to be quite slender. In a telephone call from\nNewsweek\n, Bornstein, Trump’s current doctor, said he\nwould only answer questions if I could identify the location of Mount Sinai. Assuming he was referring to the world-\nrenowned hospital, I replied “Manhattan.” He said that was incorrect,\nand asked the question again. I asked if he meant the actual Mount Sinai and he said he had not specified anything. I replied Mount Sinai was in Egypt, in the Sinai Peninsula. He said that was wrong and hung up. (While Mount Sinai is in Egypt, the location of the Mount Sinai described in the Bible as the location where God gave Moses the Ten Commandments, if that is what Bornstein meant, is the subject of debate among religious scholars.) According to the former Trump executives and the person Trump considers a friend, his drug use was widely discussed within the company as symptoms of possible abuse began to","reactions":{"like":{"$numberInt":"1"},"wow":{"$numberInt":"1"},"total":{"$numberInt":"2"}},"author":"Carl Ostendarp","profile":"https://mobile.facebook.com/carl.ostendarp"}

Trump had always been aggressive\n–\nsometime brutal\n–\nin business as well as loose with the truth, but in the late 1980s, things had become much worse. While former employees said he had often been thoughtful and caring to his staff, he suddenly exhibited abusive behavior that at times seemed irrational. His self-aggrandizement grew to delusions of grandeur, his thin skin thinned more, his decisions grew more reckless. While he had always been a liar when it was convenient, he sputtered greater numbers of falsehoods at an alarming rate and seemed to believe them. When previously he would speak in sexist ways that were fairly typical in businesses during the early 1980s, toward the end of the decade he seemed to have no filter and openly said far more inappropriate things about women. The worst impact of this recklessness may have been on his business; before the late 1980s, Trump usually focused on one major project at a time to ensure everything met his exacting standards. By the end of the decade, his reckless shopping spree was legion: he borrowed billions to open one Atlantic City casino after another, launching another one before any had turned a profit and ultimately creating a business model where he was competing with himself. As the scaffolding under his gaming business started collapsing, he borrowed even more money to buy his own airline. All of those late-1980s businesses flopped, sending Trump companies into multiple bankruptcies. Trump stopped the diethylpropion completely in 1990 under the supervision of a doctor, a former executive with his company said (ending the drug after long-term use causes serious withdrawal problems.)","reactions":{"like":{"$numberInt":"1"},"wow":{"$numberInt":"1"},"total":{"$numberInt":"2"}},"author":"Carl Ostendarp","profile":"https://mobile.facebook.com/carl.ostendarp"}

It really makes you look ridiculous. Why is it so possible for you to look the other way when the “ party” that you so support , sent 150 billion dollars (cash) to IRAN, pretended Benghazi never happened or took responsibility, etc! You seem to enjoy your 1st amendment right, and all the other things you take for granted daily, but fail to see the importance of border security. Whether or not Mexico pays for this wall ( which they ultimately will thru tariffs, sanctions, etc) , it needs to be built Now not later ( or never) , there is simply too much at risk. Have you ever consider why the government is at risk “shutting down” every year , wasteful spending on ridiculous programs voted in during previous administration ( your party, again). And FYI, social security and welfare checks will always continue to be received, on time and all government employees will be paid ! If anyone who works for the government does not set aside a few weeks pay knowing full well that fear of possible shutdown is possible which will only delay paychecks 1-3 weeks , is a IDIOT! So your rant is pointless and without substance! One of two things will happen now, either you will research the info I just given you OR you will continue to look the other way - be part of the flock of sheep who are not capable of thinking for themselves.

Congress has for decades done NOTHING but BLAME OTHERS for it's fecklessness and become rich off this constant bickering by bleeding it's citizens dry. It is written in the constitution that the government shall remain in operation and the ONLY parts that will be put on hold are the NON-ESSENTIAL parts. It is unfortunate that we have allowed congress to become, in their minds, an essential part of government. IF we would include them in the NON-ESSENTIAL class in government, and STOP PAYING THEM when such things happen, I will GUARANTEE that this sort of nonsense will cease and desist.","reactions":{"total":{"$numberInt":"0"}},"author":"Daniel Milford","profile":"https://mobile.facebook.com/daniel.milford1"}

This has not happened in the private sector only in the Federal but yet you people keep yammering that the federal employee is too highly paid and there are too many of them. The fact is, some of the positions need to be filled in order for the government to get the job done properly, but the jobs remain unfilled because of cutbacks. I know of what I speak I used to be a federal employee and my department used to carry such a heavy workload but we managed to get it done.

Since when are they allowed all these special medical policies, lifetime pensions that the rest of us can only dream of, vacation times (like the present 5 day one going on now), meals, exercise rooms, etc. etc. etc. How come someone like Obama who was a community organizer before becoming President (with I might add at a $400,000 salary) now live in a 5 million dollar home. How come all these people manage to get very rich just by working (and a I use the term lightly) for the government? I think I just answered my own question, They work for the government which includes themselves instead of the AMERICAN PEOPLE. They start lining their own pockets the minute they get inside the beltway.","reactions":{"like":{"$numberInt":"1"},"total":{"$numberInt":"1"}},"author":"Celeste League","profile":"https://mobile.facebook.com/profile.php"}

Shutting down the government is a big deal because it affects our troops in that they will not get their pay, the federal employees will not get their pay and it is right around Christmas time for all you care. Research at NIH will stop. Rangers who protect our wildlife and our parks won't be able to do that. Hopefully there will be no fires during the time they are not on duty. You sound like an abysmal person. And may I say that there are no illegal aliens only undocumented people. And the Very fact that you say if you get raped by an undocumented person that is unconscionable. A rape is more likely to happen by an American and you better check those facts out, sister. And it sounds like you are jealous of anyone who got a college education. All told, you sound like a pretty miserable person.","reactions":{"love":{"$numberInt":"1"},"haha":{"$numberInt":"1"},"total":{"$numberInt":"2"}},"author":"Lynn Fox","profile":"https://mobile.facebook.com/lynn.fox.92"}

Mexico will be paying tor the wall inadvertently via the trade deal. Checks and balances do count in the bigger picture. AS for shutting down the government , you need to catch up on real news regarding who and what will be affected if that does happen, you are in overreach. . Not that big of deal and pushing a political narrative as an excuse rather than the safety and security of Americans is very naive. One more thing America's standing on the global stage was already in tatters thanks to Obama and his band of merry misfits. The rest of your post is an overreaching effort of an open border kind of dude.and you need to reevaluate your priorities and opinions based on facts. You are not the one sitting in the W.H. having to make serious decisions.","reactions":{"love":{"$numberInt":"1"},"total":{"$numberInt":"1"}},"author":"Melanie Philip","profile":"https://mobile.facebook.com/melanie.philip.37"}
